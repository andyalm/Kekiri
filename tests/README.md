Previous test suite was comprised of the pre-V4 attribute based (as opposed to Fluent) style tests.  
Also, test suite was heavily coupled to NUnit (which is still not working with dotnetcore).

The entire suite has been removed.  It needs to be rebuilt from scratch with xUnit -- Pull requests welcome!
